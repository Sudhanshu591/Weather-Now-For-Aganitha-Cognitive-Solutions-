# **App Name**: WeatherNow

## Core Features:

- Current Weather Data: Fetches and displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description) based on the user's current location, IP address, or manually entered location. The backend will decide which of these tools is available to determine the weather.
- Location Search: Allows users to manually search for a location and view its current weather conditions.
- Detailed Forecast: Provides a simple hourly forecast (4-6 hours) or daily forecast (3-5 days) for the selected location.
- Basic UI: Display of current weather conditions including an icon representing the general weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
- Unit Switching: Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors such as location not found or API unavailability.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498db), reminiscent of clear skies and open weather.
- Background color: Very light gray (#f0f2f5) for a clean, airy feel.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#e67e22) to highlight important details like temperature.
- Font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for both headings and body text; Inter's neutral and modern appearance complements the clean design.
- Use a set of simple, outlined icons from a public library to represent different weather conditions (sun, cloud, rain, snow, etc.).
- A clean, single-page layout with a prominent display of current weather data and a search bar at the top.
- Subtle transitions and animations when loading data or switching locations to provide a smooth user experience.
